Sure! Here's a simple and clear `README.md` file for your **Rust mini project** that calculates weight on Mars:

---

```markdown
# 🪐 MartianScale

A simple Rust CLI tool that calculates your weight on Mars based on your weight on Earth. This project helps beginners understand basic Rust concepts like input/output, parsing, type conversion, and ownership.

## 📦 How to Build and Run

### Prerequisites

- Rust and Cargo installed.  
  If not installed, follow instructions from [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

### Build

```bash
cargo build
````

### Run

```bash
cargo run
```

Then enter your weight in kilograms when prompted.

## ✨ Concepts Demonstrated

* `String` input handling
* Type parsing (`String` → `f64`)
* Basic arithmetic
* Ownership, borrowing, and references
* Error handling with `unwrap()`

## 📌 Example

```bash
Enter your weight on Earth in kg:
60
Weight on Mars: 22.71 kg
```
